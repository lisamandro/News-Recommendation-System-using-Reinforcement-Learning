# News Recommendation System using Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a personalized news recommendation system using the using multi-armed bandit algorithms. It evaluates and compares algorithms like Linear Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling, UCB1, and Epsilon-Greedy to model and predict user click behavior. By simulating user interactions, the system compares these algorithms in terms of Click-Through Rate (CTR) and decision efficiency, providing insights into their performance in real-world recommendation scenarios.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Multiple Algorithms Compared**:
  - `LinUCB` (contextual bandit with user/item features)
  - `Thompson Sampling`
  - `UCB1`
  - `Epsilon-Greedy`
- **User Feedback Loop**: Accepts user clicks on recommended articles and updates the model online.
- **CTR Tracking**: Calculates and displays click-through rate based on real user interactions.
- **Performance Visualization** via CTR-over-time plots.

## Dataset

- The project uses the MIND dataset, which contains millions of news impressions and user click behaviors.
- Due to size and licensing, the dataset is **not included** in the repository.
- Users should download the dataset from the official [MIND dataset site](https://msnews.github.io/) and place it in the designated folder before running the code.

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

Below is a sample result comparing different Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms on the MIND dataset:

## ðŸš€ Future Work

- Incorporate time-aware or session-based user modeling for better personalization.
- Extend support for hybrid recommendation (content-based + collaborative).
- Integrate a real-time user interaction loop via web interface.
- Experiment with deeper neural contextual bandits (e.g., Deep LinUCB, DQN).
- Explore fairness and bias mitigation in article selection
